These new societies are plagued by murder, drug use, and theft, and intergalactic outlaws are hunted by a growing number of tough bounty hunters.\n\nSpike Spiegel and Jet Black pursue criminals throughout space to make a humble living. Beneath his goofy and aloof demeanor, Spike is haunted by the weight of his violent past. Meanwhile, Jet manages his own troubled memories while taking care of Spike and the Bebop, their ship. The duo is joined by the beautiful con artist Faye Valentine, odd child Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV, and Ein, a bioengineered Welsh corgi.\n\nWhile developing bonds and working to catch a colorful cast of criminals, the Bebop crew\'s lives are disrupted by a menace from Spike\'s past. As a rival\'s maniacal plot continues to unravel, Spike must choose between life with his newfound family or revenge for his old wounds.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]', 'https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/19644.jpg', '1998-04-03', 'Finished Airing', 26, 'TV'),

However, this routine is interrupted when Faye, who is chasing a fairly worthless target on Mars, witnesses an oil tanker suddenly explode, causing mass hysteria. As casualties mount due to a strange disease spreading through the smoke from the blast, a whopping three hundred million woolong price is placed on the head of the supposed perpetrator.\n\nWith lives at stake and a solution to their money problems in sight, the Bebop crew springs into action. Spike, Jet, Faye, and Edward, followed closely by Ein, split up to pursue different leads across Alba City. Through their individual investigations, they discover a cover-up scheme involving a pharmaceutical company, revealing a plot that reaches much further than the ragtag team of bounty hunters could have realized.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]', 'https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1439/93480.jpg', '2001-09-01', 'Finished Airing', 1, 'Movie'),
(6, 'Trigun', 'Vash the Stampede is the man with a $$60,000,000,000 bounty on his head. The reason: he\'s a merciless villain who lays waste to all those that oppose him and flattens entire cities for fun, garnering him the title \"The Humanoid Typhoon.\" He leaves a trail of death and destruction wherever he goes, and anyone can count themselves dead if they so much as make eye contact—or so the rumors say. In actuality, Vash is a huge softie who claims to have never taken a life and avoids violence at all costs.\n\nWith his crazy doughnut obsession and buffoonish attitude in tow, Vash traverses the wasteland of the planet Gunsmoke, all the while followed by two insurance agents, Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson, who attempt to minimize his impact on the public. But soon, their misadventures evolve into life-or-death situations as a group of legendary assassins are summoned to bring about suffering to the trio. Vash\'s agonizing past will be unraveled and his morality and principles pushed to the breaking point.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]', 'https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1130/120002.jpg', '1998-04-01', 'Finished Airing', 26, 'TV'),
(7, 'Witch Hunter Robin', 'Though hidden away from the general public, Witches—those with supernatural powers—have always existed in human societies. Neither numerous nor inherently evil, Witches are nonetheless capable of creating disorder by misusing their powers for criminal means. The task of solving supernatural crimes falls outside of the jurisdiction of normal authorities and is instead handled by the Solomon organization.\n\nHaving finished her training in Italy, Robin Sena transfers to Solomon\'s local Japanese branch, STNJ. Possessing powerful pyrokinetic abilities, she is herself a Witch, putting her at odds with STNJ\'s methods of dealing with rogue Witches. In particular, Robin opposes the use of an elixir called Orbo, which can weaken or even neutralize a Witch\'s powers. If Robin wants to find her place within the organization, she must find a way to navigate the internal politics of Solomon while also handling the threat of hostile Witches—but both seem to be dangerous for very different reasons.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]', 'https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/19969.jpg', '2002-07-03', 'Finished Airing', 26, 'TV'),

A young boy, Beet, dreams of joining the Zenon Squad. However, one day, as a result of Beet\'s fault, the Zenon squad was defeated by the devil, Beltose. The five dying busters sacrificed their life power into their five weapons, Saiga. After giving their weapons to Beet, they passed away.

After the cunning Youichi Hiruma—captain of the Deimon Devil Bats football team—witnesses Sena\'s rapid legs in motion, he coerces the timid boy into joining his squad.\n\nAs Hiruma wants to conceal Sena\'s identity from other clubs, Sena is forced to hide under the visored helmet of \"Eyeshield 21,\" a mysterious running back wearing the number 21 jersey. The legendary Eyeshield 21 can supposedly run at the speed of light and has achieved remarkable feats in the United States during his time at the Notre Dame College.\n\nAccustomed to avoiding his problems in the past, Sena\'s specialty might just help him become the new secret weapon of the Deimon Devil Bats. As he interacts with his teammates, Sena gradually gains more self-confidence and forges valuable bonds along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]', 'https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1079/133529.jpg', '2005-04-06', 'Finished Airing', 145, 'TV'),
